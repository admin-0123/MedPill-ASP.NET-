## Executive summary
Our Web Application aims to digitise the work at MedPill Endocrinology Clinic, a private endocrinology clinic. Our features include view, creating, modifying and deleting appointments slots, a variety of payment methods for users to pay for their treatment as well as saving card information for quick easy payment later on and creating and viewing reports. 

To access these features, users are able to login via their phone number as an alternative to traditional login methods with an email and password.

Our main innovative feature is that all of our users, from doctors to patients, are able to complete all of their tasks solely on our web application since our web application has all the necessary features.

In addition, users are now given more freedom to reschedule or cancel their appointments as they now have the power to do it themselves as compared to the older way of having to contact the receptionist or the staff of a clinic to do it for them.

Our application aims to provide a better user experience for both customers and staff alike.
